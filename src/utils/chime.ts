/**
 * The attention chimes.
 *
 * Synthesised with the Web Audio API rather than shipped as files: each is two
 * short square-wave notes and a decay, which needs no asset and cannot 404.
 * Played only when the window is not in front of the user, so they never
 * interrupt someone who is already looking at the conversation.
 *
 * Both figures come from `sound-lab/index.html`: the rising "coin" (card 13) for
 * a finished turn or a permission, and the lower growl (card 16) for a question,
 * so "answer me" does not sound like "you are free". Their gains are the ones the
 * lab measured as equally loud, so neither of them is the one that shouts.
 *
 * Electron is configured with `autoplayPolicy: "no-user-gesture-required"`, so
 * the context may start without a click; if a platform still refuses, the context
 * stays suspended and the next interaction resumes it.
